/*

Given an integer array nums where nums[i] is either a positive integer or -1. We need to find for each -1 the respective positive integer, which we call the last visited integer.

To achieve this goal, let's define two empty arrays: seen and ans.

Start iterating from the beginning of the array nums.

If a positive integer is encountered, prepend it to the front of seen.
If -1 is encountered, let k be the number of consecutive -1s seen so far (including the current -1),
If k is less than or equal to the length of seen, append the k-th element of seen to ans.
If k is strictly greater than the length of seen, append -1 to ans.
Return the array ans.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,-1,-1,-1]

Output: [2,1,-1]

Explanation:

Start with seen = [] and ans = [].

Process nums[0]: The first element in nums is 1. We prepend it to the front of seen. Now, seen == [1].
Process nums[1]: The next element is 2. We prepend it to the front of seen. Now, seen == [2, 1].
Process nums[2]: The next element is -1. This is the first occurrence of -1, so k == 1. We look for the first element in seen. We append 2 to ans. Now, ans == [2].
Process nums[3]: Another -1. This is the second consecutive -1, so k == 2. The second element in seen is 1, so we append 1 to ans. Now, ans == [2, 1].
Process nums[4]: Another -1, the third in a row, making k = 3. However, seen only has two elements ([2, 1]). Since k is greater than the number of elements in seen, we append -1 to ans. Finally, ans == [2, 1, -1].
Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,-1,2,-1,-1]

Output: [1,2,1]

Explanation:

Start with seen = [] and ans = [].

Process nums[0]: The first element in nums is 1. We prepend it to the front of seen. Now, seen == [1].
Process nums[1]: The next element is -1. This is the first occurrence of -1, so k == 1. We look for the first element in seen, which is 1. Append 1 to ans. Now, ans == [1].
Process nums[2]: The next element is 2. Prepend this to the front of seen. Now, seen == [2, 1].
Process nums[3]: The next element is -1. This -1 is not consecutive to the first -1 since 2 was in between. Thus, k resets to 1. The first element in seen is 2, so append 2 to ans. Now, ans == [1, 2].
Process nums[4]: Another -1. This is consecutive to the previous -1, so k == 2. The second element in seen is 1, append 1 to ans. Finally, ans == [1, 2, 1].
 

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 100
nums[i] == -1 or 1 <= nums[i] <= 100
